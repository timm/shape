## What


This repo shares two sets of tricks.

- _SHape_: language independent methods to support command-line 
  development using bash, Github, vim, and tmux.
- Language dependent tricks. The repo implements _Gold_ (the Gawk object layer). 

## How

See our [install](INSTALL.md) instructions and our
[guide for contributors](CONTRIBUTING.md).


## Why?

While IDEs are great, command-line development is fast,  lightweight,
and portable to anywhere we can access a terminal.
So I do a lot of command-line code developing with bash, vim, and tmux.
But no matter what language I am working in,  I usually end up with the same
directory structure, support scripts, documentation system, etc etc.
For example, whether or not I am 
coding in Prolog, Python, Perl, LISP, Smalltalk, 
CoffeeScript, LUA, Gawk, etc etc, then my work environment looks like:

I recommend these tools since, with them, you can:

- Write portable coding:
   - The methods here work anywhere you can get to a \*nix-style command line.
- Do fast install:
   - With _SHape_,
     code can be installed code without having to update config files all over your hard drive.
- Do dast uninstall:
   - With _SHape_,
     code can be quickly uninstalled, just by deleting the _SHape_ directory
- Support test-driven development:
   - _SHape_ code comprises many small files, each of which can be tested severely;
   - _SHape_'s unit tests for code in the `src/` directory are held in a separate `test/` directory.
   - All those test are re-checked by  Travis CI whenever this code is committed back to Github.
- Support doco-first development:
   - _SHape_ encourages a "docu-driven" development cycle. 
      - Code is stored in an `.md` within code blocks.
      - Executable gawk files are generated by commenting out everything _except_ the code blocks,
        then the resulting file writen into a `.var/` directory.
   - To give a repository its own identify and a common look-and-feel,
     the first paragraph of `./README.md` is  be pushed out across all the `*.md` files.
